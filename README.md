# 🎙️ Speech-Recognition-with-Translation 🌐

A modern web application for real-time speech recognition and translation. Users can speak into their microphone, view live transcripts, and instantly translate speech into multiple languages. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless multilingual communication.

## 🔍 Project Description

The **Speech Translator Web App** is an intuitive browser-based tool that captures your voice, converts it to text, and instantly translates it into your desired language — all in real-time. Designed with accessibility and simplicity in mind, the app uses modern web APIs to enable seamless speech recognition and multilingual translation through an interactive and beautifully animated interface. It also supports continuous recognition, animated UI transitions, and language auto-detection, providing a rich and user-friendly experience.
